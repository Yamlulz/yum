# How to Share YUM Email Categorizer

## Option 1: GitHub Repository (Recommended)

### Steps to create a GitHub repository:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it `yum-email-categorizer`
   - Add description: "Privacy-focused AI-powered business email classification system using local LLMs"
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: YUM Email Categorizer with local LLM support"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Share the repository URL:**
   - Direct link: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer`
   - Others can clone with: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer.git`

## Option 2: Compressed Archive

### Create a shareable ZIP/TAR file:

```bash
# Create a clean archive excluding unnecessary files
tar -czf yum-email-categorizer.tar.gz \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='__pycache__' \
  --exclude='*.pyc' \
  --exclude='.env' \
  --exclude='venv' \
  --exclude='env' \
  --exclude='.vscode' \
  --exclude='.idea' \
  .

# Or use the distribution script (see below)
./create_distribution.sh
```

## Option 3: Docker Container

### Share as a Docker image:

First, create a Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Ollama
RUN curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Copy requirements and install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Start script
CMD ["python", "backend/app.py"]
```

Then build and share:
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t yum-email-categorizer .

# Push to Docker Hub
docker tag yum-email-categorizer YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer
docker push YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer

# Others can run with:
# docker run -p 5000:5000 YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer
```

## Option 4: Cloud Deployment

### Deploy to cloud platforms:

**Heroku:**
```bash
# Create Procfile
echo "web: python backend/app.py" > Procfile

# Deploy
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

**Railway:**
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Auto-deploy on push
- Set environment variables if needed

**Render:**
- Connect GitHub repository
- Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set start command: `python backend/app.py`

## Option 5: Documentation Package

### What to include when sharing:

#### Essential Files:
- ✅ **Source code** (`backend/`, `ui/`)
- ✅ **Documentation** (README.md, SIMPLE_SETUP_GUIDE.md, guides)
- ✅ **Configuration** (requirements.txt, .gitignore)
- ✅ **Setup scripts** (setup_local_llm.sh, etc.)
- ✅ **Sample data** (categories.json, demo scripts)
- ✅ **Complete guide** (YUM_Email_Categorizer_Complete_Guide.pdf)

#### Exclude from sharing:
- ❌ Virtual environments (`venv/`, `env/`)
- ❌ IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- ❌ Cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- ❌ Environment files (`.env` with secrets)
- ❌ Large model files (users will download their own)

## Quick Setup Commands for Recipients

### For GitHub users:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yum-email-categorizer.git
cd yum-email-categorizer

# Quick setup
./setup_local_llm.sh
pip install flask requests

# Start the system
python backend/app.py
```

### For archive users:
```bash
# Extract and setup
tar -xzf yum-email-categorizer.tar.gz
cd yum-email-categorizer

# Run the installation script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Start the system
source venv/bin/activate
python backend/app.py
```
