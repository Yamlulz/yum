# Email Categorizer - Simple Setup Guide

## What This Does
This system reads your emails and automatically sorts them into business categories like "Complaint", "Sales Opportunity", "Urgent Action Needed", etc. It's like having a smart assistant that never gets tired of organizing your inbox.

## Why Use This?
- **Save Time**: No more manually sorting through hundreds of emails
- **Catch Important Stuff**: Never miss urgent complaints or sales opportunities
- **Stay Private**: Everything runs on your computer - no data sent to external companies
- **Get Smarter**: The system learns from your feedback and gets better over time

## What You Need
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Internet connection (only for initial setup)
- About 30 minutes for setup

---

## Step 1: Get the Basic Stuff Ready

### Install Python (if you don't have it)
Python is like the engine that runs our email sorter.

**Windows:**
1. Go to python.org
2. Download Python (get the latest version)
3. Run the installer
4. ‚úÖ Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Type: `brew install python` (if you have Homebrew)
3. Or download from python.org like Windows

**Check if Python is working:**
Open your command prompt/terminal and type:
```
python --version
```
You should see something like "Python 3.11.0"

### Install Required Libraries
These are like add-ons that help Python do specific tasks.

In your command prompt/terminal, type:
```
pip install flask requests
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Smart Brain (AI)

The "brain" of our system is called an LLM (Large Language Model). Think of it as a very smart robot that reads emails and understands what they're about.

### Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
We made this super easy for you:

```bash
./setup_local_llm.sh
```

This script will:
- Download and install the AI brain (called "Ollama")
- Get a smart but lightweight model (about 2GB download)
- Test everything to make sure it works

### Option B: Manual Setup (if automatic doesn't work)

1. **Install Ollama** (the AI software):
   - Go to ollama.ai
   - Download for your operating system
   - Install it like any other program

2. **Start Ollama**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Download the AI model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:3b
   ```

### What's Happening Here?
- **Ollama**: Software that runs AI models on your computer
- **llama3.2:3b**: A smart AI model that's small enough to run quickly
- **Local**: Everything stays on your computer - no internet needed after setup

---

## Step 3: Start the Email Sorter

Now we'll start the actual email categorization service.

### Start the Main Program
In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the email categorizer folder and type:
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

You should see something like:
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**What this means:** Your email sorter is now running and waiting for emails to categorize.

**Keep this window open** - this is your email sorter running in the background.

---

## Step 4: Test It Out

Let's make sure everything works before you start using it with real emails.

### Quick Test
Open a new terminal/command prompt window (keep the first one running) and type:
```bash
python demo_workflow.py
```

This will:
- Check if everything is working
- Generate some fake business emails
- Show you how the categorization works
- Give you accuracy scores

### What You'll See
The demo will show emails being sorted into categories like:
- ‚úÖ "Complaint - Product/Service" (confidence: 85%)
- ‚úÖ "Sales Opportunity - New Business" (confidence: 92%)
- ‚ùå "Action Required - Urgent Response" (confidence: 45%) - needs improvement

### Interactive Test
Want to try your own emails? Type:
```bash
python ui/cli_test.py
```

This lets you:
- Type in email subjects and content
- See how they get categorized
- Give feedback if the category is wrong

---

## Step 5: Understanding the Categories

Our system sorts emails into business-focused categories:

### üö® **Critical Issues** (Handle First!)
- **Complaints**: Unhappy customers, broken products, billing problems
- **Legal Problems**: Lawsuits, contract disputes, compliance issues
- **Crisis**: Security breaches, system outages, data problems
- **Reputation Risk**: Media inquiries, bad reviews going viral

### üí∞ **Business Opportunities** (Don't Miss These!)
- **Sales**: New customers, upgrade requests, partnership offers
- **Good News**: Success stories, awards, happy customers
- **Renewals**: Contracts expiring, subscription opportunities

### ‚ö° **Action Needed** (Someone Needs to Do Something!)
- **Urgent Response**: Emergencies, time-sensitive requests
- **Follow-up**: Waiting for updates, need to check progress
- **Executive Attention**: VIP customers, board-level decisions

### üîß **Day-to-Day Business**
- **Technical Support**: Bug reports, feature requests, help needed
- **Financial**: Invoice problems, payment issues, budget approvals
- **HR**: Employee issues, hiring, policy questions

---

## Step 6: Making It Better

The system gets smarter when you help it learn.

### Give Feedback
When the system gets something wrong:

1. Use the interactive test: `python ui/cli_test.py`
2. Enter the email details
3. See what category it picks
4. If it's wrong, tell it the right category
5. The system remembers and gets better

### Generate Training Data
Want to train it on specific types of emails? 

```bash
python generate_training_emails.py --category "Complaint - Product/Service" --count 10
```

This creates 10 realistic complaint emails to help the system learn.

---

## Step 7: Daily Usage

### Starting Your Day
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Start the AI brain: `ollama serve` (if not already running)
3. Start the email sorter: `python backend/app.py`
4. Your system is ready!

### Categorizing Emails
The system provides a web service that other programs can use. Soon, we'll have an Outlook add-in that automatically categorizes your emails as they arrive.

For now, you can:
- Test emails using the CLI tool
- Send emails to the API programmatically
- Use the demo to see how it works

### Stopping the System
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal windows to stop
- Or just close the terminal windows

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Refused" Error
**Problem:** The email sorter isn't running
**Solution:** Make sure you started it with `python backend/app.py`

### "Ollama Not Found" Error
**Problem:** The AI brain isn't installed or running
**Solution:** 
1. Install Ollama from ollama.ai
2. Start it with `ollama serve`
3. Download the model with `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`

### Slow Classifications
**Problem:** The AI is thinking hard
**Solution:** This is normal for the first few classifications. It gets faster.

### Wrong Categories
**Problem:** The system is learning
**Solution:** Give it feedback using the CLI tool. It will improve over time.
